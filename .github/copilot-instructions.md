## Abstract

This repository (lasuillard/lasuillard) is the central profile and information hub for the user **"lasuillard"** on GitHub. It manages personal/professional information, automates repeated tasks, and generates structured data for use in other repositories.

## Repository Use Cases

- Summarize and organize personal or project information.
- Generate and update resume or profile data.
- Create and maintain structured data files (e.g., JSON, YAML) for sharing across repositories.
- Automate repetitive tasks related to profile management.

## AI/Automation Instructions

- When generating or updating files:
  - Follow the coding and formatting conventions above.
  - Ensure all content is relevant to personal profile management or data centralization.
  - **Do not** include sensitive or private information unless explicitly instructed.

## AI-NOTE Syntax

- Some comments use an `AI-` prefix (e.g., `<!-- AI-NOTE: ... -->`) to provide context for AI models. You should follow:
  - Reference these comments to enrich current tasks or understand file context.
  - **Do not** add or modify these comments; they are managed exclusively by the human user to provide context for AI models.
